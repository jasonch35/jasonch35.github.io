# Gameplay Changes

At Ragnarok Online: Reforged, our goal is to offer players a modernized version of the game that retains the beloved mechanics of the original Ragnarok, while making necessary changes and rebalances to create an improved gameplay experience. We are committed to continuously enhancing and improving the server's content and episode updates, all while remaining true to the original game's principle. Therefore, these additional features complement the original gameplay of Ragnarok Online not changing them completely.

In addition, we aim to incorporate renewal content into the pre-renewal environment of our server, balancing these updates to ensure that they are in harmony with the gameplay elements that our players have come to love. We believe that this approach will enable us to provide a unique and engaging gameplay experience that appeals to both longtime fans of the game and newcomers alike.

See [Core Features](core-features.md) page for highlighted changes.

## :material-arrow-right-box:{ .mybullets } Universal and Quality of Life Revisions

- All Items' Weight reduced to 1 weight (0.1 for Ammos)

- Players can no longer open Boxes or Quivers if weight is less than the weight of the contents

- Sitting and Standing Regeneration ticks decreased by half
    -   <small>With this boost, players will be able to spend less time waiting and more time exploring.</small>

- Items with a drop rate of 10% or less are now directly added to the inventory

- Disabled RoDex mail writing

- Armors, Weapons, and Pet equipments now drop identified

- All statuses now provide status icons on the screen (e.g. Magnum Break fire damage buff)
    -   <small>This should provide players more transparency on their character's strengths and weaknesses</small>

## :material-arrow-right-box:{ .mybullets } Progressive from latest Pre-Renewal State

Our server is based on kRO's episode 10+ pre-renewal but the way we will implement episodes is to gain access to those maps corresponding to which episode it was released. Monster drops and spawn areas and maps will stay closely synchronized with Ratemyserver's database, so yes, this server is not <em>Classic</em>.

Other job classes (Supernovice, Ninja, etc.) will also be revamped and released progessively. For the case of Transcendent classes, there are no plans yet but will be considered in the future.

So if you stumble upon a Transcendent or Gunslinger gear, keep it, as it will be released and you might be interested in unlocking the class through the Multiclass system. 

## :material-arrow-right-box:{ .mybullets } Addressing Multi-Client Dilemma

While the game client is currently set to a maximum of two instances, we have come up a way for players to enhance their gameplay without needing multiple characters on separate accounts.

We think these changes will result in fewer dummy characters roaming and more real players engaging in the game.

Again, please remember that these changes are somewhat expiremental, we may be wrong about how these will affect overall gameplay.

### Forger and Brewer

Forging and Brewing Success Rate are now determined by Base Level, Job Level, Base Dex, and Base Luk. Bonus Dex and Luk from equipment, statues, etc., no longer affect the success rate. Instead, it is increased solely by the character's Base Dex and Base Luk.

The total Success Rate at Base Level 99 is calculated as if the character has effects such as Gloria, Gospel, Guild Leader passive, etc.

This change also caters to casual players who want their characters to be in the rankings.

### Endow Sage

Unrefined Elemental Stones (<em>Red Blood, Crystal Blue, etc.</em>) can now be used to endow player's weapon for 30 minutes.

Endow Sage alt characters has been utilized for a long time now, there hasn't been any critical issue since, why not provide it outright instead.

### Supportive Buffers

Though popular, Increase Agi, Blessing, Weapon Perfection, etc. alts will remain untouched. Instead, we've opted to introduce Movespeed Potions available from Tool Dealers for a small amount of zeny. This will replicate the Increase Agi walking speed bonus but will not stack. Our aim is to preserve the essential buffs provided by Acolytes without compromising their role.

### The new Party Buff system

If the new [class-exclusive party buff](/core-features/#custom-party-buffs) is deemed valuable enough to the extent that players create dummies for them, the buffs will likely be forced to undergo nerfs.
